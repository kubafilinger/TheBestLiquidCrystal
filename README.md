# TheBestLiquidCrystal
I based on this library https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/wiki/Home. At this moment I have added only a few features that help refresh the text on the screen without any visible blinks. Everything is in the LiquidCrystalI2C.h.
In the future, I plan to add more features related to even better display.

I invite you to my [blog](https://www.blog.kubafilinger.pl).
